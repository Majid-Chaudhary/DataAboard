# DataDemocrat (Working Title)

**Self-Service, On-Prem Data Mesh / Democratization Platform for SQL and ML Workspaces**
Empowering analysts, engineers, and scientists to securely explore and model data — without IT tickets, data exports, or vendor lock-in.

---

## Vision

Enable organizations to:

* Discover, request, and access datasets via a unified portal
* Launch isolated, governed SQL and ML workspaces (Trino & Jupyter)
* Enforce table-level access via Trino — not storage hacks
* Run entirely on-prem (MinIO, Ceph, HDFS, LDAP, Kubernetes)
* Stay open-source, auditable, and extensible

---

## Problem

Most organizations still rely on central IT for access provisioning, analytics infrastructure, and ML compute.
This creates delays, bottlenecks, and discourages exploration — especially in regulated or on-prem environments.

Existing tools:

* Are cloud-first or vendor-locked (Snowflake, Databricks)
* Don't connect discovery, access control, and compute in one OSS stack
* Assume centralized ETL ownership — which doesn't reflect real orgs

**OpenDataPlane solves this by acting as a control plane above your data — not inside it.**

## Architecture Overview (High-Level)

| Component               | Purpose                                                        |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **FastAPI**             | Backend API for auth, provisioning, orchestration              |
| **JWT + LDAP**          | Secure authentication + group-based access logic               |
| **Trino**               | Distributed SQL query engine with catalog-based access control |
| **JupyterHub**          | Optional ML workspace per user/team, integrated with Trino     |
| **GitLab CI/CD**        | Automates workspace provisioning & config updates              |
| **Kubernetes**          | Deploys and isolates all compute pods                          |
| **MinIO / Ceph / HDFS** | Storage backend for Iceberg/Delta tables                       |
| **OpenMetadata**        | Data discovery, metadata catalog, and lineage API              |

---

## Key Features

* Web-based UI for search, access requests, workspace launching
* Secure access via LDAP, JWT, and Trino policies
* S3-compatible or HDFS-based Parquet table access via Trino
* Jupyter notebooks for ML — directly on Iceberg/Delta data
* Metadata and lineage integration via OpenMetadata API
* Fully Kubernetes-native and GitOps-friendly

---

## Who Is This For?

* Enterprises with large on-prem datasets and internal analysts
* Data platforms seeking governance without vendor lock-in
* Data science teams who want on-demand compute without fighting IT
* Architects who want composable, OSS-based data control planes
